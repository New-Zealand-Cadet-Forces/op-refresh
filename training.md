## NZCF Training Overview

<p class="lead">Aside from all the great experiences you'll have as a cadet, you will also take away training, leadership and discipline skills that will set you apart from the crowd when you head to university or begin your chosen career.</p>

The New Zealand Cadet Forces (NZCF) has a nationally coordinated four year training programme which provides challenges and opportunities that no other organisation can, every Cadet is given the opportunity to gain knowledge and develop skills in a variety of different areas. The training programme is designed to take cadets from a basic or introductory level of knowledge and skills, to an advanced level of knowledge and skills throughout the four year programme in a wide range of areas and subjects. 

Cadets will typically learn the theory of each subject on their Parade Night (meeting night), with cadets meeting weekly during the school term, usually in the early evening for three - four hours. Cadet Units will hold weekend activities and camps throughout the year, so that the Cadets can further test and develop their skills in a practical environment. 

Our training is broken down into two basic parts- Common Training and Corps Training. 

The common training is designed so that every cadet nationwide gets the same level of knowledge. NZCF Common Training includes, but is not limited too:

* First Aid
* Drill and Ceremonial Training
* Firearms Safety and Marksmanship Training 
* Leadership
* Physical Training and Fitness
* Uniform Care and Maintenance
* Teamwork Skills
* Navigation
* Radio Usage and Drones
* Cadet Forces and General Service Knowledge
* Risk Management and Safety
* Community Involvement, including at Commemorative Events such as ANZAC Day. 

Each Corps also has some training that is specific to them, and this makes up the Corps training part of our programme: 
* Navy Cadet specific training includes sailing, pulling, ropework such as knots and use of pulleys, and other seamanship skills such as coxswain skills and navigating on open water.
* Army Cadet specific training includes fieldcraft-based skills such as camouflage and concealment, section and platoon skills, and outdoor activities such as tramping and patrolling. 
* Air Cadet specific training includes power flying, gliding, air navigation and other aviation related content such as the parts of an aircraft and theory of flight. 


Throughout their time in the NZCF, cadets will get the opportunity to be involved in Cadet [Local and Regional Courses](cadetcourses.html) and Competitions as well as activities with other Cadet Units in their Local Area, have the opportunity to apply for [International Exchanges](overseas.html) and the Duke of Edinburgh Hillary Award.
