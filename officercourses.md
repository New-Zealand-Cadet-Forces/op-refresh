## Officer Courses

It's not just our cadets that receive training, as an Officer you will need to lead by example which can only be achieved by having fully trained, qualified, capable officer staff so that you can set the example. The good news is we provide all the training and qualifications so that you can feel confident, capable and knowledgeable when leading the cadets! Plus, you’ll receive the benefit of gaining extra qualifications, which you can then use in other career areas.

All officers have a number of national courses and online training modules to work through to assist in their progression and development, these include both leadership (promotion) courses and specific skill training courses. This development pathway ensures that you're learning in a structured way, and gaining new skills at the right time to put them into practice.

As you become more experienced as an officer, you’ll begin to take on extra responsibilities and have further opportunities to attend local and national courses or activities to develop your skills, and train the cadets in a different environment away from your unit.
