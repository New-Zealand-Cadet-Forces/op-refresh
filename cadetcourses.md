## Cadet Local & National Courses

As you become more experienced as a cadet, you’ll begin to take on extra responsibilities and have further opportunities to attend Local and National Courses to develop your skills. 

Depending on your Corps, you will have a number of local and national courses available to you throughout your NZCF careers. These include both leadership (promotion) courses and specific skill training courses. Cadet Units also participate in regional and national skills competitions or regattas.

All of the training activities conducted through the Common Training Programme (link to overview of NZCF training) including weekly parade nights, camps, range shoots, and community events such as ANZAC Day commemorations build a range of skills to help the cadets succeed at these local and national courses.
