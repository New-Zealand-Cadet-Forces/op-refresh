<h2>Dare to Take the Challenge...</h2>
<p>
  The New Zealand Cadet Forces (NZCF or Cadet Forces) is a voluntary, uniformed
  organisation which provides military-style leadership, personal development
  opportunities and adventure based training to youth aged between 13 and 19
  years old. Through its three branches- Sea Cadets, Army Cadets and Air Cadets-
  the Cadet Forces provides youth with a hands on nationally coordinated
  training program which provides challenges and opportunities that no other
  organisation can; while a number of local, regional and national courses
  provide further experience and qualifications in specific training areas.

  <h2>The oldest youth organisation in NZ</h2>
  <p>
    The Cadet Forces is a non-profit organisation for the youth of New Zealand
    which has existed continually since 1864, and in its present form in a
    partnership with the New Zealand Defence Force and locally appointed community
    organisations since 1971, making it New Zealandâ€™s oldest youth organisation.

      Our aim is to instil leadership and honourable values in our youth so as

      New Zealanders, who come out feeling stronger than ever, and are armed
      with skill sets that will last them a lifetime.

    <h2>Building young leaders</h2>
    <p>
      Cadets have the opportunity to take part in unique adventurous, fulfilling
      and educational activities in a military-like environment. Through these
      activities, cadets get the chance to develop a sense of purpose,
      responsibility, self confidence, self respect, self discipline, self
      reliance, leadership ability, and commitment to voluntary service.

    <h2>Personal development</h2>
    <p>
      Many former cadets comment that the cadet experience helped to develop
      them as an individual, achieve personal growth, leadership qualities and
      provide them with a sense of community service.
