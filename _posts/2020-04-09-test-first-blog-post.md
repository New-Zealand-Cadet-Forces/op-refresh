This is the first blog post on the dev site for NZCF refresh.

This site is live, hosted on Netlify, but it contains code that prevents Google from finding it so you have to know the URL to visit it.

If you are an invited blog author, the dashboard is at <https://nzcf-dev.netlify.com/admin/> and the blog index page is at [](https://nzcf-dev.netlify.com/admin/)<https://nzcf-dev.netlify.com/blog> (which anyone can visit).

The idea is that authorised people, invited by email, can author public blog posts on the NZCF website after the refresh project is public. I'm making this quite a long post to pretty much test out the styling on a blog post, so it needs to resemble a real one to a certain degree.

## Main tasks

Main tasks for the refresh include:

* Migrate content from the existing site
* Clean the div soup from the old content
* Convert (rebuild) the site to be more maintainable using Jekyll and Sass
* Brag about using the Jamstack to build serverless sites
* One day find out that the site doesn't scale as needed, and start all over again with a different stack



> How will a blockquote style?

The above question should answer itself.

### Kitchen sink

Might as well do a few bits now.

*A table, just for kicks, but written in markdown because the editor doesn't have a button*
