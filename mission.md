## MISSION, VISION AND VALUES

As members of the NZCF we are individually and collectively responsible for how we conduct ourselves. We are regularly in the public eye within our communities and how we carry ourselves, what we say and what we do are scrutinised continuously, even when we think no one is watching. As such, how we go about our business is sometimes just as important as the outcomes we achieve.

All of us in the NZCF, wherever we are, are also entitled to expect a certain level of behaviour from others in our organisation. Our values are more than just words. They form the fundamental foundation of why we are here and dictate the necessary high standards and expectations of our organisation.

### Vision

Preparing New Zealand’s successful leaders of tomorrow.

### Mission

To develop and enable self-disciplined, confident and responsible young New Zealanders.

### Core Values

**Courage** – Confronting challenges, both physical and moral, to overcome any adversity.

**Commitment** – Being reliable and loyally serving and supporting the NZCF, local communities and New Zealand.

**Comradeship** - Looking out for each other, having respect for all, and championing the benefits of friendship, teamwork and diversity.

**Integrity** – Having self discipline and always being honest, trustworthy and responsible.

### Aims

To foster a spirit of adventure and teamwork, and to develop those qualities of mind and body essential for good citizens and leaders.
To provide challenging and disciplined training activities, which will be useful in either Service or civilian life.
To promote an awareness of the Armed Forces, and the role they play in the community.

## NZCF CODE OF CONDUCT

**Our <a href="https://www.cadetnet.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NZCF_Code_of_Conduct.pdf">Code of Conduct.</a>**

#### WHO DOES IT APPLY TO AND WHEN?

This Code applies to anyone who is engaged by New Zealand Cadet Forces, regardless of the position or rank held. This includes Supplementary Staff who are permanent, temporary or casual within an NZCF unit, volunteers and any other groups or individuals we have advised this Code applies to.

This Code also applies to what we do outside of the NZCF environment where our actions may bring NZCF or NZDF into disrepute or may damage the trust and confidence that the NZCF or NZDF has in us.

#### HOW CAN WE BE SURE OUR CONDUCT COMPLIES WITH THE CODE AND POLICIES?

The Code provides general guidance and minimum expectations of the behaviour NZCF expects from us. No code or policy can cover every situation, so we need to consider our values, apply our common sense and act with self-respect, and consider the reputation of NZCF and NZDF in our decision making.

The individual circumstances of each situation will determine how the misconduct is treated. Please use the SELF test to guide your decision making, or if you need further clarity talk to your Cadet Unit Commander or Area Support Officer before you take a course of action you think may fall outside the guidance outlined in this Code.

#### The SELF Test

IF IN DOUBT, IT MAY HELP TO CONSIDER THE SELF TEST QUESTIONS:

SCRUTINY - would your decision or behaviour withstand scrutiny and be seen as appropriate by others?

ENSURE COMPLIANCE - does your decision or behaviour comply with the Code and other NZCF policy, Cadet Force Orders and procedural expectations?

LAWFUL - is your decision or behaviour lawful?

FAIR - is your decision or behaviour fair and reasonable?

NZCF prides itself in being one of the most trusted youth organisations in New Zealand. By being consistently honest and ethical, and applying SELF to our behaviour and decision making, we help bring our vision and values to life.
